The directory structure is the organization of files into a hierarchy of folders.

In a single-level directory system, all the files are placed in one directory.
There is a root directory which has all files. 
It has a simple architecture and there are no sub directories. 

Advantage of single level directory system is that it is easy to find a file in the directory.
